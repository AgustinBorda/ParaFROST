\section{Introduction}
This paper presents a brief description to our solver \parafrost which stands for \emph{Parallel Formal Reasoning Of SaTisfiability} in 4 different configurations. Our solver is based on state-of-the-art CDCL search~\cite{grasp,minisat,glucose}, integrated with preprocessing as presented in SIGmA (SAT sImplification on GPU Architectures)~\cite{sigmaTacas,sigmaIfm} and a new technique called Parallel Decision Making (PDM)~\cite{pdcl}. However, all submitted versions only allows a single-threaded CPU execution.

\parafrost provides easy-to-use infrastructure for SAT solving and/or preprocessing with optimized data structures for both CPU/GPU architectures, and fine-tuned heuristic parameters. The \emph{Parallel} keyword in \parafrost intuitively means that SAT simplifications can be fully executed on variables in parallel as described in~\cite{sigmaTacas} using the Least Constrained Variable Elections (LCVE) algorithm while periodically, via the PDM procedure~\cite{pdcl}, the solver is capable of making decisions that can be assigned and propagated in parallel as well. Choosing variables to preprocess or decisions relies heavily on \emph{freezing} (that is where FROST originated) mutually independent variables according to some logical properties.

\section{Preprocessing}
In previous work, we have shown how Bounded Variable Elimination (BVE) and hybrid subsumption elimination (HSE) can be performed in parallel on Graphics processing Units (GPU) which proven to be effective in increasing the amount of reductions within a fraction of second, e.g. 66$\times$ speedup compared to SatElite when combined together in \texttt{ve+} mode~\cite{sigmaTacas}. This mode iterates over BVE and HSE in several rounds untill no literals can be removed. Moreover, we
have added new implementations for blocked clause elimination (BCE) and a new type
of elimination we call hidden redundancy elimination (HRE)~\cite{sigmaIfm}. HRE repeats the following until a fixpoint has been reached: for a given formula $\mathcal{S}$ and clauses $C_1\in\mathcal{S},C_2\in\mathcal{S}$ with $x\in C_1$ and $\bar{x}\in C_2$ for some variable $x$, if there exists a clause $C\in S$ for which $C\equiv C_1 \otimes_{x} C_2$ and $C$ is not a tautology, then let $\mathcal{S} := \mathcal{S} \setminus \{C\}$. The clause $C$ is called a \emph{hidden redundancy} and can be removed without altering the original satisfiability.
For example, consider the formula $\mathcal{S}=\{\{a,\bar{c}\},\{c,b\},\{\bar{d},\bar{c}\},\{b, a\},\{a,d\}\}$.
Resolving the first two clauses gives the resolvent $\{a,b\}$ which is equivalent to the fourth clause in $\mathcal{S}$. Also, resolving the third clause with the last clause yields $\{a,\bar{c}\}$ which is equivalent to the first clause in $\mathcal{S}$. HRE can remove either $\{a,\bar{c}\}$ or $\{a,b\}$ but not both.

In this submission, a sequential implementation of all simplifications described above is provided as part of \parafrost with light workload. By default, in \parafrost the \texttt{ve+} is enabled with light number of \texttt{phases} set to 2. The \texttt{phases=<n>} option applies \texttt{ve+} for a configured number of iterations, with increasingly large values of the threshold $\mu$ (maximum occurrences of a variable). In another configuration (e.g. \parafrostHRE), the \texttt{HRE} method is enabled.

All configurations delay preprocessing by a user-defined number of restarts. This gives the solver enough time to solve trivial problems (solved in few seconds), especially large formulas before simplifications are executed. The number of restarts needed to activate preprocessing is set to 50 through the option \texttt{pre-delay=<n>}. The solver supports geometric~\cite{geoRestart}, luby~\cite{minisat}, and dynamic restarts~\cite{dynamicRestarts}. However, in this submission, we enable only dynamic restarts.
